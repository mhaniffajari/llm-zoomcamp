If your main aim is to get certified in machine learning and data science skills that were taught during the course I would advise registering before it officially begins as there could be assignments worth several points only given out at specific rounds of lectures which are then graded after each round, so late enrollees may miss some opportunity for more grades. This information applies to the \"machine-learning-zoomcamp\". If your priority is getting certified or pass a particular segment in machine learning and AI that you couldn\\'t previously due to other commitments now being free from this responsibility, then I recommend joining late as these courses tend not too penalizing for belated enrollees.\\nThe \"data-engineering-zoomcamp\" course officially starts on 15th Jan 2024 at 9:00pm (GMT). If you are able to start working from this date but don\\'t want official credit, the materials will still be available afterward for self-learning.\\nPrioritize setting up prerequisites like Google Cloud Account and Python with Anaconda before starting your course as instructed in \"data-engineering-zoomcamp\". The information above applies to this particular Data Engineering Zoom Camp Course only, other courses may have different enrollment policies. Please verify directly by checking each respective online resources for their specific details on late registrations and deadlines.'"

However, make sure not to leave everything for last minute and consider joining/registering for clarity.\\n2. It is essential first-hand knowledge from within each specific course provider should be sought before making an enrolment as most courses will have policies regarding joinings post the start of a class, this was exemplified in context: 'Yes, even if you don’t register' which can suggest potential implications for joining late.\\n3. The suggested preparations include installing and setting up dependencies like Google Cloud Account, SDK; Python 3 installed via Anaconda; Terraform & Git as well as reviewing prerequisites/syllabus before the course begins. You might want to consider these steps also after starting this once you join.\\n\\nWithout specific policies from a particular Zoom Camp instructors' policy, usually courses have enrollment periods which don't exceed beyond their commencement, therefore for accurate information best would be directly contacting an admin or asking them via the provided course communication channel within that context platform.\""
