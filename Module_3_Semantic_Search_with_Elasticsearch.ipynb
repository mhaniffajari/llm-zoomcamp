We can parse this file name from the URL and use it as csv_name. That is, we can replace csv_name = “output.csv” with\\ncsv_name = url.split(“/”)[-1] . Then when we use csv_name to using pd.read_csv, there won’t be an issue even though the file name really has the extension csv.gz instead of csv since the pandas read_csv function can read csv.gz files directly.',\n",

If you have, make sure you run a terraform destroy before trying again as you will have likely partially created resources which will cause errors next time you run `terraform apply`.\\n`terraform destroy` may not completely delete partial resources - go to Google Cloud Console and use the search bar at the top to search for the ‘app.name’ you declared in your variables.tf file; this will list all resources with that name - make sure you delete them all before running `terraform apply` again.\\nWhy are my GCP free credits going so fast? MAGE .tf files - Terraform Destroy not destroying all Resources\\nI checked my GCP billing last night & the MAGE Terraform IaC didn't destroy a GCP Resource called Filestore as ‘mage-data-prep- it has been costing £5.01 of my free credits each day  I now have £151 left - Alexey has assured me that This amount WILL BE SUFFICIENT funds to finish the course. Note to anyone who had issues deploying the MAGE terraform code: check your billing account to see what you're being charged for (main menu - billing) (even if it's your free credits) and run a search for 'mage-data-prep' in the top bar just to be sure that your resources have been destroyed - if any come up delete them.\",\n",

IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters\\nAs the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS\\n2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:\\nconf = SparkConf() \\\\\\n.setMaster(\\'local[*]\\') \\\\\\n.setAppName(\\'test\\') \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\\n5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:\\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\\\\n.config(conf=sc.getConf()) \\\\\\n.getOrCreate()\\n6.)

You can rectify this by:\\n“export DBT_PROFILES_DBT=path/to/profiles.yml”\\nEg., /home/src/magic-zoomcamp/dbt/project_name/\\nDo the similar for DBT_PROJECT_DIR if getting similar issue with dbt_project.yml.\\nOnce DIRs are set,:\\n“dbt debug –config-dir”\\nThis would update your paths. To maintain same path across sessions, use the path variables in your .env file.\\nTo add triggers in mage pipelines via CLI, you can create a trigger of type API, and copy the API links.\\nEg. link: http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/10/pipeline_runs/f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\\nThen create a trigger.py as such:\\nimport os\\nimport requests\\nclass MageTrigger:\\nOPTIONS = {\\n\"<pipeline_name>\": {\\n\"trigger_id\": 10,\\n\"key\": \"f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\"\\n}\\n}\\n@staticmethod\\ndef trigger_pipeline(pipeline_name, variables=None):\\ntrigger_id = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"trigger_id\"]\\nkey = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"key\"]\\nendpoint = f\"http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/{trigger_id}/pipeline_runs/{key}\"\\nheaders = {\\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'}\\npayload = {}\\nif variables is not None:\\npayload[\\'pipeline_run\\'] = {\\'variables\\': variables}\\nresponse = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)\\nreturn response\\nMageTrigger.trigger_pipeline(\"<pipeline_name>\")\\nFinally, after the mage server is up an running, simply this command:\\npython trigger.py from mage directory in terminal.\\nCan I do data partitioning & clustering run by dbt pipeline, or I would need to do this manually in BigQuery afterwards?\\nYou can use this configuration in your DBT model:\\n{\\n\"field\": \"<field name>\",\\n\"data_type\": \"<timestamp | date | datetime | int64>\",\\n\"granularity\": \"<hour | day | month | year>\"\\n# Only required if data_type is \"int64\"\\n\"range\": {\\n\"start\": <int>,\\n\"end\": <int>,\\n\"interval\": <int>\\n}\\n}\\nand for clustering\\n{{\\nconfig(\\nmaterialized = \"table\",\\ncluster_by = \"order_id\",\\n)\\n}}\\nmore details in: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs',\n",

You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\\nThey consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\\nAdded by Muhammad Awon',\n",

The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that’s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn’t contain any part of your y_train.
